1) Demo page
- Header above form: “Request appointment — Prof Demo Consultant (ENT · The London Clinic)”
- Success message after submit: “Thanks — we’ll contact you within 2 hours. A confirmation has been emailed (you’re CC’d).”

2) Simple admin to add a seat
- Add passworded page: /admin/seats  (env: ADMIN_PASSWORD)
- Fields: Consultant Name (auto-slug), Booking email, Specialty, Hospitals
- Buttons: [Save] → writes to DB and makes /c/<slug> live; [Save & Test] → also sends a test referral (PDF attached) to the booking email and CCs info@regentscare.com.
- List existing seats with Edit/Disable.

3) Patient form — insurer with Self-pay


4) Payments (minimum viable)
- Create Stripe Product “RegentsCare Seat” @ **£149/month**.
- Generate a **Stripe Checkout Link** and add a button “Start paid plan (£149/m)” on /seats (or /admin/seats).
- Add /billing/success and /billing/cancel simple pages. (Webhooks can be added later.)

5) Small cleanups
- /seats page: show “Book a 5-min install: info@regentscare.com” (or redirect to mailto).
- Privacy copy: “GDPR-compliant. Email via Postmark (DKIM/SPF/DMARC). Data sent securely; removal on request.”
- Always **BCC info@regentscare.com** on referral emails.

Env vars: ADMIN_PASSWORD, POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN (already), STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY.

Acceptance:
- I can add a consultant on /admin/seats and get a live /c/<slug>.
- “Save & Test” sends a referral email with PDF to the booking inbox (and BCCs info@).
- Insurer dropdown works; Self-pay hides policy and appears in subject/PDF.
- Stripe Checkout opens from the button and returns to /billing/success
